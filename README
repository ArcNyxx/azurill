azurill - init system
=====================
azurill is an init system and daemon handler for Unix-based operating systems.

Installation
------------
azurill comes with a Makefile and config.mk file for configurable building and
testing.  Edit the latter to match your local setup (azurill is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default, you may need to modify your $PATH).

azurill can be built and installed with the following command (run as root):

    make clean install

Further configuration will be necessary, extensively researching your
distribution prior to changing init systems is highly recommended.  Scripts and
other programs may need to be created to run azurill successfully.
